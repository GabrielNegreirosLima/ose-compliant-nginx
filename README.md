# Nginx with Open Standards Everywhere
Nginx docker image and configuration using the ISOC OSE (Internet Society - Open Standards Everywhere) tutorials.

## Why
Protocols and good practices for security in web servers have been around for a pretty good time, but not always the system administrators have the knowledge or the time for studying these protocols and good practices. Aware of that, Internet Society has created the [Open Standards Everywhere](https://www.internetsociety.org/issues/open-standards-everywhere/) that consist of clear written tutorials for implementation in Web servers as Nginx or Apache.
